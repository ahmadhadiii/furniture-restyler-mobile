# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-06-17

> Patch release: fixes the **Android AR camera preview** not rendering. The
> live camera background now displays correctly during AR sessions.

### Fixed
- **Android camera background rendering.** The ARCore camera background is now
  drawn each frame by binding the external OES texture and setting the
  `sTexture` sampler uniform — previously the background could appear black
  because the camera texture was never bound during the draw pass. Thanks
  [@deandreamatias](https://github.com/deandreamatias). See
  [#12](https://github.com/AminMemariani/augen/issues/12) /
  [#13](https://github.com/AminMemariani/augen/pull/13).

### Changed
- **Renderer micro-optimization.** `CameraBackgroundRenderer` now resolves its
  shader attribute/uniform handles once after the program links instead of
  querying them on every frame.

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-15

> Patch release: the iOS plugin now ships with **Swift Package Manager** support
> alongside CocoaPods, and the Android build is compatible with **16 KB memory
> page sizes** (required by Google Play for apps targeting Android 15+).

### Added
- **Swift Package Manager support (iOS).** Added `ios/augen/Package.swift` and
  relocated the Swift sources to `ios/augen/Sources/augen/`, so the plugin
  resolves as a Swift Package while continuing to work with CocoaPods. The
  `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` manifest is now bundled by both build systems. See
  [#9](https://github.com/AminMemariani/augen/issues/9).

### Changed
- **Android 16 KB page size support.** Upgraded the Android toolchain so native
  libraries are 16 KB-aligned: Kotlin `2.2.0`, Android Gradle Plugin `8.12.1`,
  Gradle `8.13`, Java `17`, and ARCore `1.54.0`. See
  [#7](https://github.com/AminMemariani/augen/issues/7).

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-03

> Minor release: the lighting and occlusion method channels are now fully
> implemented on **iOS** and **Android**. Calls that previously slipped past the
> support checks and then threw `MissingPluginException` now return real,
> platform-truthful data.

### Added
- **Lighting native handlers (iOS + Android).** `getLightingCapabilities()`,
  `setLightingConfig()`, `addLight()`, `removeLight()`, and `updateLight()` are
  now handled natively. iOS creates real RealityKit `DirectionalLight` /
  `PointLight` / `SpotLight` entities; both platforms report a truthful lighting
  capability map (`maxLights`, `shadowQuality`, light-estimation flags).
- **Occlusion native handlers (iOS + Android).** `getOcclusionCapabilities()`,
  `setOcclusionConfig()`, `setOcclusionEnabled()`, and `isOcclusionEnabled()` are
  now handled natively. iOS toggles people-occlusion frame semantics
  (`personSegmentation`, plus `personSegmentationWithDepth` on LiDAR devices);
  Android toggles the ARCore Depth API (`Config.DepthMode.AUTOMATIC`) on
  supported devices. Capabilities are reported from real device queries rather
  than hard-coded values.

### Fixed
- **`MissingPluginException` on `getLightingCapabilities` and
  `setOcclusionConfig`** (and the rest of the lighting/occlusion surface). These
  methods previously had no native handler, so once a device reported
  `isLightingSupported == true` / `isOcclusionSupported == true`, the follow-up
  capability and config calls crashed the demo. They now answer truthfully and
  degrade gracefully (return empty / no-op) on older OS versions or when no
  session is running.

### Changed (non-breaking)
- All new handlers degrade gracefully instead of throwing: iOS guards behind
  `#available` and a running `ARWorldTrackingConfiguration`; Android guards
  behind ARCore depth-support checks and an initialized session.

> **Note:** On Android the renderer does not yet draw added lights or placed
> nodes (ARCore here renders the camera background and plane detection only).
> These handlers stop the crashes and report honest capabilities; full
> scene-graph rendering on Android remains future work.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-31

> Minor release: environmental-probe capabilities are now implemented on iOS,
> the web pipeline is WebAssembly-ready, and the example app is verified stable
> across iOS, Android, and Web.

### Added
- **`getEnvironmentalProbesCapabilities()` implemented on iOS.** The native
  handler reports real ARKit/RealityKit environment-texturing capabilities
  (supported resolutions, max active probes, automatic/manual placement) instead
  of returning `MissingPluginException`.
- **WebAssembly readiness.** The web camera service no longer performs a
  JS-interop runtime type check that was incompatible with `dart2wasm`; the web
  build now passes the wasm dry-run cleanly.

### Fixed
- `getEnvironmentalProbesCapabilities()` and the environmental-probe
  configuration path degrade gracefully (return empty / no-op) when a native
  handler is absent, instead of surfacing `MissingPluginException` in the UI.
- **Example app:** replaced the stale generated widget test (which always
  failed) with a real smoke test, and wrapped optional environmental-probe setup
  so a missing native handler no longer prints an error to the status overlay.

### Changed (non-breaking)
- Example app verified to build and run on **iOS, Android, and Web**; the whole
  package passes `flutter analyze` with no issues and all 611 tests green.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-27

> Bug-fix release focused on iOS demo crashes reported by early adopters.
> The plugin now degrades gracefully when a capability is missing on the
> running platform or when the controller has been disposed.

### Fixed
- **`MissingPluginException` on iOS** — `isEnvironmentalProbesSupported`,
  `isCloudAnchorsSupported`, `isOcclusionSupported`, and the other support
  checks no longer crash when the native side has no handler. They now
  return `false` and log a debug-only warning.
- **`Bad state: Controller is disposed`** — `setImageTrackingEnabled` and
  `setFaceTrackingEnabled` no longer throw when fired during tab switches
  or widget rebuilds. They return `false` and push a user-friendly message
  to `errorStream` instead.
- **iOS native handlers** — added explicit support-check handlers in
  `AugenARView.swift` using real ARKit capability APIs
  (`ARImageTrackingConfiguration.isSupported`,
  `ARFaceTrackingConfiguration.isSupported`,
  `supportsFrameSemantics(.personSegmentation)`, etc.) instead of
  hard-coded `true`. Cloud anchors and multi-user honestly report `false`
  because no backend ships with Augen.
- **Android native handlers** — mirrored the new support-check method
  names so the channel contract matches across platforms.
- **iOS Podspec** — bumped from `0.1.0` to `1.2.1`, fixed placeholder
  author / homepage metadata, and aligned the iOS deployment target.
- **Example Podfile** — uncommented `platform :ios, '13.0'` so the demo
  app builds against the documented minimum iOS version.

### Added
- `AugenController.isDisposed` — public getter so callers can guard before
  invoking mutation methods (which still throw `StateError` after dispose
  by design).

### Changed (non-breaking)
- `setImageTrackingEnabled` and `setFaceTrackingEnabled` now return
  `Future<bool>` instead of `Future<void>`. Existing `await` call sites
  continue to compile without changes; new code can use the return value
  to drive UI state.

### Tests
- **+13 new tests** covering `MissingPluginException`, `PlatformException`,
  and `UnsupportedError` paths for all 7 support checks and both toggle
  methods, plus `isDisposed` getter behavior and dispose idempotency.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-21

> Augen now runs on **three platforms** — Android (ARCore), iOS (RealityKit/ARKit),
> and **Web (WebAssembly + getUserMedia)**. Marker-based AR works in the browser
> with an image-template detector that matches a PNG/JPG marker against the live
> camera feed.

### Added — Web platform
- **Web marker-based AR** with `package:web` + `dart:js_interop` (no `dart:html`, `dart:js`, `dart:js_util`, or `package:js`)
- `ARMarkerTarget`, `ARTrackedMarker`, `ARMarkerDetectionOptions`, `Vector2` models
- `imagePath` field on `ARMarkerTarget` for PNG/JPG markers
- `ARSessionConfig.markerTracking` and `ARSessionConfig.markerDetectionOptions`
- Marker tracking API on `AugenController` — `addMarkerTarget`, `removeMarkerTarget`, `setMarkerTrackingEnabled`, `setMarkerDetectionOptions`, `addNodeToTrackedMarker`, `removeNodeFromTrackedMarker`, plus `markerTargetsStream` and `trackedMarkersStream`
- `AugenWebPlugin` registration with platform-view factory for `augen_ar_view`
- `WebCameraService` with `getUserMedia`, soft `facingMode` hint, automatic fallback to any camera, bounded permission timeout, typed exceptions for `NotAllowedError` / `NotFoundError` / `OverconstrainedError` / `SecurityError`
- `WasmMarkerDetector` running on `requestAnimationFrame` with FPS gate, frame-in-flight guard, `visibilitychange` listener (pauses when tab is hidden), and `errorStream`
- `WebSceneRenderer` with pooled `Float64List` transform buffer and typed `JSFloat64Array` JS interop
- `WebMarkerAnchorManager` skips updates for markers with no attached nodes
- `WebAssetLoader` with static `Completer` race guard, `window.AugenWebAR` auto-detection, and path-injection validation
- **JS bridge `web/augen_web_ar.js`** — multi-scale **normalized cross-correlation (NCC)** template matching against PNG/JPG markers, with pose estimation from apparent marker size and configured physical width
- Conditional imports for web/mobile separation (`dart.library.io` / `dart.library.js_interop`)
- Standalone web demo project `example/web_marker_ar/` runnable with `flutter run -d chrome --wasm`
- New "Web Marker AR" tab in the main example app

### Added — Tests
- **+103 new tests** (487 → **590** total)
- Marker model coverage: `ARMarkerTarget`, `ARTrackedMarker`, `ARMarkerDetectionOptions`, `Vector2`, updated `ARSessionConfig`
- Platform-backend abstraction tests
- Marker stream fast-path / slow-path tests
- Asset cache tests
- Plane normalization tests (`onPlanesUpdated` shape)
- E2E integration tests for the web example app via `flutter drive` + Chrome (`example/web_marker_ar/integration_test/`)

### Changed — Architecture
- `AugenController` now routes through `AugenPlatformBackend` instead of using `MethodChannel` directly
- `AugenView` uses conditional imports for platform-specific implementations
- 103 controller call sites converted from generic `invokeMethod` to typed backend methods (failing fast on unsupported platforms instead of `MissingPluginException`)
- Animation method stubs on Android/iOS now return `FlutterMethodNotImplemented` instead of silently succeeding
- Asset loading cached via static LRU (50 MB budget) — repeated `addNode(modelPath:)` no longer re-reads the bundle

### Performance
- **Web render loop**: `Timer.periodic` → `requestAnimationFrame` (vsync-aligned)
- **Web frame allocations**: pooled `List<double>`/`List<Vector2>` in `_convertResult`, single `DateTime.now()` per batch instead of per marker
- **Web transform interop**: pre-allocated `Float64List` reused per `updateMarkerTransform`; `JSArray<JSNumber>` → `JSFloat64Array` typed array
- **Web fast path**: `List<ARTrackedMarker>` passes directly from web backend to controller, skipping the `toMap`/`fromMap` round-trip
- **Android plane events**: throttled from 60 Hz → 10 Hz with dirty-flag suppression of unchanged states
- **Skip empty anchors**: marker transforms with no attached nodes don't traverse the renderer

### Fixed — Mobile critical bugs
- **iOS memory leak**: added `deinit` releasing `ARSession`, anchors, planes, channel handler, and Combine subscriptions
- **Android `hitTest` GL race**: `session.update()` + `frame.hitTest()` now run on the GL thread via `glSurfaceView.queueEvent`, results returned on the UI thread (fixes sporadic `SessionPausedException` and frame-state corruption)
- **Android plane event name mismatch**: native side emitted `onPlanesDetected`, Dart listened for `onPlanesUpdated` (silently dropped events) — both platforms now agree on `onPlanesUpdated`
- **Android plane payload mismatch with iOS**: payload normalized to `{center: {x,y,z}, extent: {x,y,z}, type: "horizontal"|"vertical"}`
- **iOS channel calls from delegate thread**: `notifyPlanesUpdated` and `didFailWithError` now dispatch to main via `DispatchQueue.main.async`
- **Android `arSession` data race**: marked `@Volatile`
- **Android `dispose` ordering**: anchors detached, planes/nodes cleared, session paused before close — prevents resource leaks on hot-restart
- **iOS `dispose`** clears scene anchors and nils the session delegate

### Fixed — Web stability
- `ARSessionConfig.markerTracking` now auto-enables marker tracking on web during `initialize()` (previously had to call `setMarkerTrackingEnabled(true)` manually)
- Stream subscription is set up **before** the detection loop starts (prevents dropped events on broadcast streams)
- `_processFrame` guards against adding to a closed stream controller
- Detector frame errors surfaced via `errorStream` instead of being silently swallowed
- Pattern/binary asset path injection prevented (`assets/` prefix, no `..`, no absolute URLs)
- `isSecureContext` check before `getUserMedia` with clear HTTPS error
- Typed exceptions for camera errors: `web_camera_permission_denied`, `web_camera_unavailable`, `web_camera_overconstrained`, `web_camera_permission_pending`, `web_camera_play_timeout`, `web_camera_fallback`
- Camera-constraint fallback: if `facingMode: 'environment'` fails, retry with `{video: true}` (fixes desktops with only a front camera)
- Bounded timeouts on `getUserMedia` (10s) and `video.play()` (5s) — never hangs indefinitely
- Video element appended to container **before** `getUserMedia` (Safari requires attached element for `play()` to resolve)
- `pause()`/`resume()` on web also pause/resume the video element
- `_disposed` flag on web backend prevents operations after disposal
- `maxDetectionFps` clamped to minimum 1 with assertion
- `loadBridgeScript` race condition prevented with static `Completer`
- Bridge auto-detection: skips loading if `window.AugenWebAR` is already defined (e.g. via `<script>` in `index.html`)
- `videoWidth === 0` and `readyState < 2` guard in `_processFrame`
- Tab visibility listener pauses/resumes detection loop when tab is backgrounded
- `dispose()` idempotent on controller (safe to call twice)
- `AugenWebPlugin.viewRegistry` cleared on backend disposal (no leak)
- `addLight` / `addEnvironmentalProbe` return types aligned with backend interface

### Limitations / Known Gaps
- Web marker pose estimation is a **simplified template-matching implementation**, not full ARToolKit Wasm — translation is derived from apparent marker size; rotation is identity. Production-quality pose requires bundling ARToolKit Wasm or OpenCV.js POSIT.
- Web 3D rendering via Three.js is **not yet integrated** — the renderer maintains scene state and marker transforms but does not draw geometry. Camera overlay and marker tracking work; visible 3D content requires Three.js wiring.
- Roughly 88% of Dart-side AR methods (cloud anchors, face tracking, occlusion, physics, multi-user, lighting, environmental probes, advanced animation, image tracking) are **not yet implemented natively on Android/iOS** — they correctly return `FlutterMethodNotImplemented` rather than silently succeeding. Planes, anchors, hit-test, basic nodes, and marker tracking (web) work end-to-end.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-18

### Fixed
- iOS build error: `MeshResource.generateCylinder(height:radius:)` is only available in iOS 18.0+. Gated the call behind an `#available(iOS 18.0, *)` check with a box fallback for older deployment targets.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Improved
- **README** — Rewrote from 940 lines to ~200 lines. Removed duplicated code examples, completed roadmap, inline changelogs, and emoji clutter. Focused on installation, platform setup, quick-start examples, and architecture overview with pointers to Documentation.md for advanced topics.
- **Documentation** — Fixed broken section numbering (duplicate sections 9 and 12), removed 790 lines of stale implementation logs, outdated test counts, and README-duplicated content. Merged duplicate animation sections, promoted Multi-User AR to its own top-level section, and rewrote the table of contents to match the corrected 12-section structure.

### Fixed
- Outdated version references in Documentation.md (was `^0.4.0`, now `^1.1.0`)
- Footer version in Documentation.md (was `1.0.0`)
